# FED_Programming_Challenge
## Advanced Frontend Developer Programming Challenge

| This is a front-end engineer programming exercise designed to test the skills required to maintain an eCom site utilizing modern technology native to the browser.

Your task is to create a hierarchical menu displaying products by collapsible categories with “add to favorites” functionality.

1. Create a new github repo and make public via a gh-pages branch.
2. Create an index.html file. This file should be semantic, accessible, responsive, and discoverable.
    * Accessible - Landmark ARIA roles - passes Lighthouse tests - keyboard navigable
    * Responsive - Displays on a mobile device and passes Google mobile tests
    * Discoverable - SEO fundamentals, SMM Open Graph, and JSON-LD
3. Create a single script element. Code all logic within this element. Use no external libraries.
    * Using the Fetch promise API get [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neodigm/FED_Programming_Challenge/refs/heads/gh-pages/products.json). Combine into a normalized JS data structure.
    * Iterate through the data structure and generate the HTML elements and event listeners.
    * Hovering over a product name will reveal it’s sale price
    * Clicking / tapping on any of the products should “Add to Favorites”. This state will display a heart toggle (SVG) next to the product. The list of favorite products will persist between sessions in local storage. Mock a Google Analytics custom event to capture that the product has been favorited.
4. Create a single style element. Code all CSS within this block. Use no external libraries.
    * Use BEM naming
    * Use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox
    * Try not to use `!important`
5. Test your work on various modern browsers
6. Send us the link to your finished repo

Tips: If you cannot finish simply do the best you can and explain your thought process in the comments. Work at your own pace. We prefer quality over speed.
